MIDN Dan Beverly, Nick Falsey, Young Kim, Eugene Om, and Gage Vernon's AY22 SCY Capstone

Welcome to our capstone!

# Description
This capstone was inspired by our work in SY202: Cyber Systems Engineering. There are several valid security concerns surrounding many legacy industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. With limited ability to install or uprade modern intrusion detection and prevention systems, system security can be difficult to ensure. 

Using PFP Cybersecurity's implementation of an artificial intelligence integrity-assurance software and hardware suites, we wanted to determine the viability of incorporating monitoring capabilities to everything from modern IOT devices to larger-scale ICS and SCADA systems. You can read more about their developments here: https://www.pfpcyber.com/

In addition, read more about our backgroud research, implementation, and testing in our capstone report.
